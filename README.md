# Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (VNPR) and Information Access System
## Description
This repository contains the source code for a Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (VNPR) system developed using YOLOv8 for object detection, EasyOCR for optical character recognition, and OpenCV for image processing. The system allows for rapid license plate detection from live camera feeds, enabling efficient access to information related to recognized license plates.

## Getting Started

To get started with the VNPR system, follow these steps:

 1. **Install YOLOv8:**
   ```bash
# Clone the YOLOv8 repository
!git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov8.git

# Change directory to YOLOv8
%cd yolov8

# Install dependencies
!pip install -U -r requirements.txt
 ```
2. **Install EasyOCR:**
 ```bash
 !pip install easyocr
 ```
4. **Install OpenCV:**
 ```bash
 !pip install opencv-python
 ```
